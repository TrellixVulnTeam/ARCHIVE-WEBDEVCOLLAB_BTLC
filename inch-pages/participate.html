      <h2>How do I get my own badge?</h2>
      <p>
        To get a badge for your own projects, <a href="{{ site.inch_pages.project_yaml_url }}">edit this file on GitHub</a> and <strong>add your project</strong> in the form <code>username/repo</code>:
      </p>
      <a href="{{ site.inch_pages.project_yaml_url }}"><div class="edit-file"></div></a>
      <p>
        Then submit the change to create a pull request.
      </p>
      <p>
      I will in turn send you a pull request with your updated README (and a link to your "Inch Page", so you can check it first).
      </p>

### So is this a fully featured CI service?

No, not yet at least. This is a ***community driven project*** based on GitHub Pages, passion, pull requests and a bit of manual labor on my part.

Inch Pages is a social project at heart.
We can always implement a full-blown web-service after we have convinced a broader audience of the importance of inline documentation.

But for now, the important bits for raising the visibility of code documentation are there: ***badges and status pages***.

      <p>
        So: <a href="{{ site.inch_pages.project_yaml_url }}">add your project!</a> Pull requests are fun!
